# MEPS Visualizations
Here is short descriptions for each script and intructions how to execute them.

## Contents

 **Script** | **Description**
 :---          | :---
`AIC.py`       | Analysis increments. 
`CallesEgna.py`| Different tools for data extraction and plotting.
`EPSgram.py`   | Combines member data generated by `Fetch_epsgram_data.py` from previous six hours (30 mbr ensemble). Creates then probabilistic charts for different parametres. 
`Fetch_epsgram_data.py` | Decodes member data for pre-defined locations. Fetches 5 MEPS mbrs per one hour and store the data in binary format. Needed for EPSgram and aviEPSgrams.
`MTG.py`          | Creating meteograms from input data.   
`SFX.py`          | Surfex analysis fields from input data.
`WMP.py`          | Creating weather maps from input data.
`aninc_arch.pl`   | Archiving of monthly average plots for analysis increments.
`aviEPSgrams.py`  | Same functionalities than `EPSgram.py` but plots aviation related parameters.
`run_Charts.sh`   | Creates `WMP.py` charts for whole forecast period.

## Execution

### AIC.py
When executing the script, is needed to provide the forecast cycle as a command line argument. For example, `python3 AIC.py 06` can be used. The input data location and filename are specified in the `filekey` parameter. The resulting output figures will be saved in the `wrkdir` directory.

### EPSgram.py

### Fetch_epsgram_data.py

### MTG.py

### SFX.py

### WMP.py

### aviEPSgrams.py
